"""
A hash function is a mathematical algorithm that takes input data and produces a fixed-size string of characters, which is typically a hash code.
It is commonly used for data retrieval, cryptography, file integrity verification, and more.
A good hash function is deterministic, produces a fixed-size output, is efficient,
and exhibits the avalanche effect (small input changes result in vastly different hash values).
Hash functions play a crucial role in ensuring data integrity, security, and efficient data retrieval in various applications.
